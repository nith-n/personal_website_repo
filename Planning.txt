Assignment – 1: Planning

Being a student with a major in applied computer science, I’m going to take my career in the direction of beign a programmer. 
Therefore, I’m going to use this website in the future as a portfolio website to advertise the achievements I’ve made in my programming journey. 
The website will be categorised into various divisions such as academic achievements, personal projects, work experience etc. 
I want the website to be extremely modern, truly pushing the limits of what I can do in web development. 
Plenty of dynamic elements will be included in the website to make it as versatile and visually striking as possible. 
It should be convenient for me to update my information so that the website can be up to date on all my accomplishments.
